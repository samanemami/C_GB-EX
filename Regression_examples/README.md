# Regression examples
The related examples for the multi-output regression problem are included here. 

## Scatter plot

The [scatter](scatter.py) illustrates the scatter plot regarding the predicted values of two C-GB and MART models against the real values. 
It shows the data distribution and model R2 score regarding the different depths for the decision tree regressors. 

Moreover, to have a clear idea about the relationship between the predicted and real values of each method and target, the hexbin plot within scatter plot has included.



# Examples

In the following, you can find the example plots of different scatters.
