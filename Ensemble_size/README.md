In this part, we are trying to estimate the size of the ensemble and have a comparison. The goal is to build a smaller ensemble with better performance and higher training speed.

One approach besides the memory consumption is to count the number of leaves in the ensemble. It is easy to see that a tree with fewer leaves is shorter and leed to a smaller ensemble.
