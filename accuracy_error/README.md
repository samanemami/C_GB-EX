## Precision

In the following [class_precision](class_precision.py), you can find an example of precision for each class and a different maximum depth of a three-class classification dataset and two MART and C-GB models. It will plot the precision for different classes and different depths. The evaluation of the model performances is illustrated in this example concerning the new base learner.


## loss curve
The [loss_curve](loss_curve.py), reveals the loss curve for a toy multi-class classification and two MART and C-GB models. The loss curve, is plotted regarding different boosting epochs.
